# Shadowverse Classify

A script that analyzes JCG data and classifies archetypes played by players.


### 1. Providing sample decks
In order for this script to work well, you need sample decks to analyze archetypes.  
You can use the following code to generate samples inside the `samples` folder  
    python jcg_lists.py -c __jcg-code__ 
where `jcg-code` is the code for the jcg tournament you want to use as sample.

This will generate new files inside the `samples` folder with the following format `craft-n.csv`  
Those files can be used in the other script, `cluster.py` to identify archetypes.


### 2. Archetype Clustering

`cluster.py` requires you to input the name of the output json file, which is usually the  
format name. For example, 
    python cluster.py -f celestial-dragonblade.json 

While running this script, you will be provided with sample decks for each archetype detected  
by the algorithm. You will then input the archetype name as follows:

And you should pick the proper name for the archetype given the deck list.

After you go through the process, you will find a new json file created that looks similar to this:
![json output](https://s3.ca-central-1.wasabisys.com/github-readmes/2022-09-25%2021_28_31-roar-of-the-godwyrm.json%20-%20shadowverse-classify%20-%20Visual%20Studio%20Code.png)

This file will be used by the analyzer to determine the card archetypes.


### 3. JCG Analysis
After running all the scripts, you will then be able to run the `analyzer.py` script as follows:
    python.py analyzer.py -c __jcg-code__ -f __format-file__
where `format-file` is the file generated by `cluster.py`

The end result will bring 4 files:

- `<jcg-date>-lineups.csv`: Contains info about player names and lineups used.
- `<jcg-date>-archetypes.csv`: Contains info on archetypes used and their numbers
- `<jcg-date>-crafts.csv`: Contains infor about the crafts used by players.
- `<jcg-date>-classified-decks`: Contains a list of each deck link along with its archetype name.

### 4. Example of analysis output:
This is an example of the resulting `<jcg-date>-lineups.csv` file ran for the JCG on 25th of September.

### 5. Credits
This work was inspired by [Zhiff's](https://github.com/Zhiff/ShadowverseUtility) repository, which is used to make user-friendly `.xlsx` files of the JCG analysis.  
Also, thanks to [Finalysis](https://github.com/finalys/Finalysis-Walkthrough) for the information on how to generate the database, which I copied and used in my files.

### 6. Conclusion
If you have any suggestions on this project, please let me know. I will be happy to accept  
any pull requests that improves this script's performance, or makes it more user-friendly.

Currently, I do not plan on making a GUI for this project, because it will be mainly used  
with another project to feed data into the database.
